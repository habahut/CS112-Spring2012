class Player(Sprite):
	def update(can redefine stuff here)

sprite.kill()
	removes this sprite from all groups
	DO NOT MAKE A GLOBAL VARIABLE REFERENCING ANY SPRITE
	KILL WILL NOT REMOVE THIS



sprite groups are the equivalent of arrays for sprites
http://pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.Group


Group.clear(pass it the background image):
	will redraw only the parts where the sprites were
	will keep backgrounds constant


pygame.image()
	ONLY USE BITMAPS


->>>>group_single saves a single sprite in the group

pygame.sprite.spirtecollide() 	     see if the sprite impacts the group


groupcollide(bullets, enemies, True, True)
	for every bullet that hits an enemy, kill the bullet, kill the enemy
			actually runs the "kill()" method, which can be rewritten

group collide(bullets, enemies, False, True)
	same but the bullet goes through enemies

re-write the kill function for player (and maybe the bullet) to instead decrease health


to make a custom array, inherit "list" class:
class myList(list):
		
class Horrible(object):
	def __getattr__(self, k):
		return k

	h = Horrible()
	print h.has_key(k)		sine "has_key" is not defined in the object it calls the __getattr__
	"has_key"
