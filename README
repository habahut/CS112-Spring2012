I did a lot of computer science in high school. I got a 4 on both the AP Comp Sci A and AB exams. I also built a few simple video games on my own time, pac man and a simple version of area flat. At Lehigh I used mat lab pretty extensively, but then I stopped doing computer science all together randomly. I'm still not sure why I did that, but I haven't done much programming at all in a couple of years now.

I'm not sure what I want to get out of this class. I'd like to make a really cool video game that includes mouse support. 3D would be awesome, though I'm not sure how feasable that is. Also, I'd like to be able to make a multiplayer game that I could play with my girlfriend. More generally I am hoping to get a fun re-introduction to programming.
